# NCL-ipython-notebooks

NCL notebook examples using an NCL kernel for Jupyter notebooks. 

## Used Software

### NCL kernel

You need to install suvarchal's IPyNCL IPython notebook NCL kernel before you can start using the examples.

### ImageMagicks

The scripts use ImageMagicks convert to cut off white space of the plot files.

## Known Problems

The examples won't run correctly online in GitHub because the NCL kernel and ImageMagicks is not installed.
